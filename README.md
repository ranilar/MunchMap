# MunchMap
Don't remember exactly the restaraunts you've been to? Or perhaps intrested in what places your friends have eaten at?  
That's where MunchMap comes in! It's almost like a social media but with food!

Features:
- Mark and see restaurants on the map, where you or your friends have been to.
- Write a review for friends to see what you thought about the place
- Find a place to eat at that fits your stomach's needs
- Review basic information about the restaurants
  
UPDATE 1.0.2:
The application has a login page, a registering page and the front/map page.
There aren't many features to be tested now, but you can try messing around with these pages:
/, /map, /register

In the next update I will have added databases to support the application and hopefully you can add markers and reviews on the map.
